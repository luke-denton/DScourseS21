\section{Introduction}
I chose economics as a major when I was starting college because it seemed like the only major that was interesting. From that point, I have learned that economics and data science are key tools that can help me in my career. I want to work in the nonprofit sector in some capacity and help with international development or any form of local nonprofit work that aims to end poverty and satisfy people's basic needs. I wanted to take this class to learn more about what data science really is and if it's a possible career path for me. I don't have any ideas for my project at the moment other than continuing research on the interesting part of my research project from last semester, which noted that black employed workers were more likely than any other race to vote by a high margin. I want to learn all of the material taught in this class so that I can apply it in a career that allows me to use data for the good of other people. I don't have a lot of plans after graduation, I still have 2 semesters left after this one and I'm hoping an internship this summer can give me some clarity on specific areas where I want to work.
